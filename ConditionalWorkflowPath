//use case: issue is in status A. 
  //issue has 3 available outbound transitions (B,C,D) and you only want to conditionally display those transitions based on the value of another field called "Path"
  
Scritped (Groovy) Condition

Groovy Script:
issue.get("insert custom field name here") == "enter path option here"

Repeat this process on all 3 transitions.
